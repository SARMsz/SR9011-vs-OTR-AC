<h1>SR9011 vs OTR-AC: Which One Actually Delivers?</h1>

<p>Iâ€™ve run both <strong>SR9011</strong> and <strong>OTR-AC</strong> solo, tracked every workout, every pound lost or gained, and now Iâ€™m laying it all out. These two compounds work differentlyâ€”one targets endurance and fat loss, the other gives you the anabolic effect of Ostarine but hits harder. Here's my full breakdown of what you can expect.</p>

<h2>How I Tested These SARMs</h2>
<p>Each SARM was tested over a separate 6-week solo cycle:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No other SARMs or compounds stacked</li>
  <li>Training 5x/week (push-pull-legs)</li>
  <li>Clean dietâ€”high protein, calorie-adjusted</li>
  <li>Metrics tracked: bodyweight, body fat %, PRs, sleep, side effects</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Is SR9011?</h2>
<p><strong>SR9011</strong> is a Rev-ErbA agonistâ€”not technically a SARM, but itâ€™s often grouped in due to how it's used. It boosts metabolic rate, increases endurance, and helps burn fat fast. Itâ€™s non-hormonal, so no PCT needed. I used <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/sr9011/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this SR9011 from Chemyo</a>.</p>

<h3>My SR9011 Results</h3>
<p>I lost just over 5 lbs of fat in 6 weeks without changing my calorie intake. Endurance was nutsâ€”short rest times didnâ€™t phase me, and cardio felt easier. No strength increase, but muscle definition popped by week 3.</p>

<h3>SR9011 Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Cranks up metabolism</li>
  <li>Insane endurance boost</li>
  <li>No suppression, no PCT</li>
  <li>Non-hormonal = safer long term</li>
</ul>

<h3>SR9011 Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Needs 2â€“3 doses per day (short half-life)</li>
  <li>Not anabolicâ€”wonâ€™t build muscle</li>
  <li>Best with cardio-focused training</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Best for:</strong> Cutting, endurance, fat loss</h4>

<h2>What Is OTR-AC?</h2>
<p><strong>OTR-AC</strong> (Ostarine-O-Acetate) is a modified version of MK-2866 (Ostarine) with better bioavailability. It kicks in faster, feels stronger, and delivers quicker results than traditional Ostarine. I used <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/product/otr-ac-solution/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this OTR-AC from Chemyo</a>.</p>

<h3>My OTR-AC Results</h3>
<p>This compound is like Ostarine on fast-forward. By week 2, I was already fuller, stronger, and holding pumps longer. I gained about 4.5 lbs of lean muscle over 6 weeks and felt no crash after. Recovery was smoother tooâ€”DOMS (muscle soreness) went way down.</p>

<h3>OTR-AC Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fast-acting, high bioavailability</li>
  <li>Lean muscle growth + strength boost</li>
  <li>Improves recovery and joint support</li>
  <li>Mild suppression (manageable)</li>
</ul>

<h3>OTR-AC Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Still causes some suppressionâ€”mini PCT may be needed</li>
  <li>Not ideal for extreme cutting phases</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Best for:</strong> Lean bulking, recomposition, recovery</h4>

<h3>My Verdict:</h3>
<p>If you're focused on <strong>shredding fat and pushing cardio limits</strong>, <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/sr9011/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SR9011</a> is the play. Itâ€™s non-hormonal, and the endurance benefits are real.</p>
<p>If you want <strong>fast lean gains with recovery support</strong>, <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/product/otr-ac-solution/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OTR-AC</a> hits harder and faster than classic MK-2866.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<h3>Is SR9011 a SARM?</h3>
<p>No, itâ€™s a Rev-ErbA agonist, but itâ€™s often grouped with SARMs because of how itâ€™s used for performance and fat loss.</p>

<h3>Does SR9011 build muscle?</h3>
<p>No. Itâ€™s for fat loss and endurance. It wonâ€™t build lean tissue like OTR-AC can.</p>

<h3>Do I need PCT for SR9011?</h3>
<p>No. Itâ€™s non-hormonal and doesnâ€™t suppress testosterone.</p>

<h3>Do I need PCT for OTR-AC?</h3>
<p>Maybe. It causes mild suppression. I ran a short Nolva PCT and felt fine.</p>

<h3>Can I stack SR9011 with OTR-AC?</h3>
<p>Yes, and they complement each other. One boosts endurance and burns fat, the other helps you retain muscle. Just monitor your energy and recovery.</p>

<h3>Which works faster?</h3>
<p>OTR-AC. Youâ€™ll feel it in the gym within 7â€“10 days. SR9011 kicks in around week 2 for endurance and fat loss.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Both <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/sr9011/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SR9011</a> and <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/product/otr-ac-solution/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OTR-AC</a> workâ€”but in very different ways. I wouldnâ€™t use them for the same cycle unless you're stacking. If you want to get shredded, go with SR9011. If you're trying to grow lean muscle and recover faster, OTR-AC is a no-brainer.</p>
<p>Tested them both. No hypeâ€”just real results.</p>
